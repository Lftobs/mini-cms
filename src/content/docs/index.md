# Introduction to Mini CMS

Mini CMS is a lightweight, developer-focused content management system that connects directly to your GitHub repositories. It allows you to manage MDX and Markdown files with an elegant, interactive dashboard and a powerful rich-text editor, all while keeping your content under version control.

## Why Mini CMS?

- **GitHub Native:** Your content stays in your repository. No separate database for content.
- **MDX Support:** Edit rich content with JSX components seamlessly.
- **Elegant UI:** A modern, glassmorphic interface designed for clarity and speed.
- **Version Control:** Every change is a commit. Track history and collaborate using GitHub's infrastructure.

## Key Concepts

### Organizations

Manage multiple projects under an organization. Organizations help you group related repositories and manage access for your team.

### Projects

A project is linked to a specific GitHub repository. You can configure which directories are editable and manage project-specific settings.

### The Editor

Our editor provides a WYSIWYG experience for Markdown and MDX, with live previews and support for custom components.
